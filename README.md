# PerFail 2022
This workshop aims to emphasize sharing negative results, lessons learned, and experiences of failed experiments in the area of pervasive computing. As a negative result, we consider studies run correctly (in the light of the current state of the art) and in good practice, but fail in terms of proof of the hypothesis or come up with no significance. The badness of the work can also come out as a properly but unfittingly designed data collection, an unconvincing evaluation, simulation, or measurements. When presenting the negative results and lessons learned, we aim to prevent other researchers working on similar problems to avoid certain pitfalls and avoid wasting time and energy on approaches that do not lead to fruitful results. We welcome papers that are not only honest with their “negative” results but also highlight possible steps that should be taken to avoid future failures. Overall, the workshop will provide researchers studying all areas of pervasive computing important insights in risks due to research methodology design choices.
